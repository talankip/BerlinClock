Berlin clock kata

The Berlin Clock (Mengenlehreclock or Berlin Uhr) is a clock that tells the time using a series of illuminated coloured blocks.
The top lamp blinks to show seconds- it is illuminated on even seconds and off on odd seconds.
The next two rows represent hours. The upper row represents 5 hour blocks and is made up of 4 red lamps. The lower row represents 1 hour blocks and is also made up of 4 red lamps.
The final two rows represent the minutes. The upper row represents 5 minute blocks, and is made up of 11 lamps- every third lamp is red, the rest are yellow. The bottom row represents 1 minute blocks, and is made up of 4 yellow lamps.

Feature 1 -  Converting Digital Time to Berlin Time
  1. Implement the Single Minutes Row
  2. Implement the Five Minutes Row
  3. Implement the Single Hours Row
  4. Implement the Five Hours Row
  5. Implement the Seconds Lamp
  6. Integrate the Entire Berlin Clock
  
Feature 2 - Converting Berlin Time to Digital Time
This has a limitation of not converting to exact seconds.
